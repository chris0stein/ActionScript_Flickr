ActionScript for Flickr API
===================
This is a repository to put some sample and helper code for working with the Flickr API using Flash ActionScript.

### Flickr API
The Flickr API can be found here [http://www.flickr.com/services/api/](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/). This is the general Flickr API and doesn't have ActionScript specific code in it. See later on in this doc for that.

You will also need to create an account at Flickr and get an API Key. [www.flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com)


1. Click on You > Your Apps
2. Click “Get Another Key” button
3. Click “Non Commercial”
4. Name your app, can just be MMP 420 or something that makes sense.
5. Under what are you building write a short description. Be honest and complete like "Test application I'm writing to see how the Flickr API works with ActionScript."
6. Check the boxes
7. Copy the key (not the secret) you see on the next page. You can get back to it later if needed.


### Flickr ActionScript 3.0 API Library
In order to actually connect with the Flickr API I used this library owned by Mike Chambers and hosted at Google code: [https://code.google.com/p/as3flickrlib/](https://code.google.com/p/as3flickrlib/) 

Fair warning: it hasn't been actively developed in a while and does not map 100% to the current state of the Flickr API. It does have a BSD license so maybe some adventurous person will move it to GitHub and update it. For now, that person is not me.

I'm starting this repository to respond to a request from  a watcher of my YouTube videos about Flash and Flickr so it has one file for now. I may add more examples in the future. Here are the videos:
